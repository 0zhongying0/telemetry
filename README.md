# Network Anomaly Data Sets

This data set is for anyone interested  in working with network anomaly based
machine learning, data science and research.

Our goal is to start with data sets and documentation that are geared to supervised 
learning that will allow for development of various models, test and train against 
the data set.  At some point in the not to distant future, we will publish data sets 
that will carry the same types of anomalies and abnormal behavior that occur 
"at random" for unsupervised learning.  

More complex data sets will also be provided where any number and differing type of 
event occurrences  which drives towards more real life situations and a movement towards
a greater capability for automation, remediation, behavior pattern recognition and so on.
Host/Application metrics will be added soon.

Telemetry files for machine learning/data science/research communities 

In the data set folders you will find the data sets in a CSV format, a header definition
file and the case data file which will reflect the events, time of the events and the 
device(s) where event triggers are initiated.

You will aslo find ground truth that reflect the topology, all connections 
cdp neighbors) and device types.

telemetry_topology_maps.pdf provides you:

    slide 1 logical topology map with links colored based on the numbe of ECMP links and speed
    
    slide 2 actual connected topology
    
    slide 3 device types in position
    
CDP_ground_truth_v1.pdf file shows all device connections for the network under test
